# jsoo-react

Bindings to [React](https://reactjs.org/) for [js_of_ocaml](ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/), including JSX ppx.

Adapted from [ReasonReact](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/).

`jsoo-react` allows to use React from OCaml, but it is still at the **experimental** phase: there is no published version in [opam](opam.ocaml.org/) yet, and the library is expected to break backwards compatibility often.

Bug reports and contributions are welcome!

## Getting started

### New project

For new projects, the best way to start is by using [`spin`](https://github.com/tmattio/spin) with the [`spin-jsoo-react` template](https://github.com/tmattio/spin-jsoo-react/).

Install spin [following the instructions](https://github.com/tmattio/spin#installation) and run:

```bash
spin new https://github.com/tmattio/spin-jsoo-react.git
```

### Existing project

1. Install the `jsoo-react` package and [gen_js_api](https://github.com/LexiFi/gen_js_api) dependency:

```bash
opam pin add -y gen_js_api https://github.com/jchavarri/gen_js_api.git#typ_var
opam pin add -y jsoo-react https://github.com/jchavarri/jsoo-react.git
```

2. Add `jsoo-react` library and ppx to [dune](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) file of your executable JavaScript app:

```
(executables
 (names index)
 (modes js)
 (libraries jsoo-react.lib)
 (preprocess
  (pps js_of_ocaml-ppx)))
```

3. Provision React.js library

`jsoo-react` does not make any assumptions about how you will load React.js in your application. There are 2 ways of doing so.

#### With Webpack (or any JavaScript bundler)

If you want to use Webpack, Rollup, Parcel or any other JavaScript bundler, include the following two files in your application source folder:

- `react.js`:
  ```js
  joo_global_object.React = require('react');
  ```
- `src/react-dom.js`:
  ```js
  joo_global_object.ReactDOM = require('react');
  ```

Then add them to your application `dune` file so they can be linked:

```
(executables
 ...
 (js_of_ocaml
  (javascript_files react.js react-dom.js)))
```

Note that at this moment, `jsoo-react` is compatible with React 16.

#### With `<script>` tags

If you are not using any JavaScript bundlers, and just loading the `bc.js` artifact generated by Dune, you can just add the following HTML tags to your `index.html` page:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
```

Make sure they are loaded before your application `bc.js` artifact.
